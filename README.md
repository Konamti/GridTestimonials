## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I didn't know I could manipulate the postion of background image using the x and y axis.
It was interesting to learn this property.

```css
background-position-x: calc(100% - 70px);
```

### Continued development

I would like to learn more on the postion of items and images using the flexbox.
